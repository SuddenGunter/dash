To start your Phoenix server:
  
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Generate SSL cert for local testing with `mix phx.gen.cert` (your browser must trust that certificate for HTTPS to work, but configuration depends on the browser) 
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) or ðŸ”’[`localhost:4001`](https://localhost:4001) from your browser.
